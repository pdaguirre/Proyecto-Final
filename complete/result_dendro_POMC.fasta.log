Host:    Lotorres-mac5.PUCE.EDU.EC (SSE4.2, 10 GB RAM)
Command: ./iqtree2 -s aln_dendro_POMC.fasta -m GTR+R+I -bb 1000 -alrt 1000 -safe -pre result_dendro_POMC.fasta
Seed:    685357 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Thu Jun 27 13:53:59 2024
Kernel:  Safe SSE2 - 1 threads (8 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 8 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.
